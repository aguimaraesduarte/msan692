            <h2 style='color: white;'>"The main reason I'm personally accumulating assets is in order to fund this." - Elon Musk</h2>
            <p style='color: white;'>If you agree with what Elon is saying, make a commitment below to donate $10,000 to the Million Mars Pledge. Our mission is to find only 1 million people on the planet earth to donate $10,000 each to this cause. If we're able to do this, we could fund the early stages of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qo78R_yYFA" target="_new" style="color: red; background-color: black; padding: 2px;">this Mars transport system</a>.</p>

          <h2>Put Politics, Capitalism, and Other Interests Aside for a Moment</h2>
          <p>Do you read Science Fiction? Do you follow developments in space exploration? The last time we as a <em>planet</em> did something meaningful in space was decades ago.</p>
          <p>If you feel anything like I do, you'd gladly give a large portion of money directly to the effort to "back up" our planet and ensure the human race could survive a catastrophic event on earth. We're not affiliated with Elon Musk or SpaceX, but we're ready to hand over our list of interested donors to them when we have a significant enough number of people on board.</p>
          <p>We could argue about the fact that SpaceX is likely to do an IPO to raise money, that governments <em>should</em> be funding this or anything else. Or we could mobilize and find, out of 7 billion people on this planet, a simple million that can each donate $10,000. Think of where we could go in our lifetimes!</p>

          <p>Commit to donating $10,000 directly to SpaceX if this thing hits critical mass, or a portion of a $10,000 block.</p>

          <h2>Who runs this site?</h2>
          <strong>I'm literally just a guy who saw Elon's talk and realized that we're the only ones holding ourselves back.</strong>
          <p>We have the resources right here on planet earth and they don't even make up a meaningful fraction of the GDP of the US, one country in the <em>entire world</em>. If there was ever a time to act with a global posture, that time is now.</p>
