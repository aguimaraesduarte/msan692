Most of the time, we&rsquo;ll never know the causes of surprise cost increase that can come from a supply shortages in a component good, or an industrial strike at a supplier&rsquo;s plant.\r\n\r\nQuietly, and in an effort to gain supply chain transparency, Flex (which rebranded, changing its name from &ldquo;Flextronics&rdquo; last year) has built a system to help spot risks, track orders and generally bring an unprecedented level of information about its supply chain operations. The Silicon Valley-based technology and manufacturer has built a new technology platform to pierce deep into its supply chain.\r\n\r\nTo the uninitiated, this sounds unexceptional, even expected. However, the dirty secret with much of corporate America is that it struggles with technology. It even struggles with knowing who its suppliers are.\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s not unusual for companies to have over 10,000 suppliers and each of these, replete with multiple orders and goods in transit, is virtually impossible to track. Most companies don&rsquo;t even try. Consequently, we see many disruption and sustainability scandals hit the press, with the affected organisation just as surprised by the supply chain revelations as the press.\r\n\r\nThis is also a problem from a knowledge perspective. Most supply chain managers lack the accurate <a href='http://www.forbes.com/risk/'>risk</a> information to inform their decision making. They are also ill-equipped with tracking tools.\r\n\r\nFirms are often reluctant to make the investment into risk analysis and mitigation tools because of the cost. Senior management are reluctant to part with millions when they cannot quantify a clear business case. How do you count the benefits of a risk avoided?\r\n\r\nAs a result, some companies are paralysed by lack of credible numbers.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\nIn more than 30 countries and over 100 facilities around the world, Flex takes a creative view of risk. The flip side of risk is opportunity. A dynamic, uncertain situation breeds opportunities to move faster than competitors.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Risk factors have tangible results that we definitely report to our board,&rdquo; says Marcin Fic,  Vice President, Supply Chain Solutions. &ldquo;But some factors are intangible. Speed, for example, is a critical factor here and it&rsquo;s something that our executives want. Velocity of the supply chain fuels our efficiency, improves our competitiveness and that of our customers, and helps deliver superior numbers..&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTo achieve greater velocity within its supply chain, Flex has developed its own sophisticated system of data collection and aggregation to provide more visibility into its supplier operations. This data allows a company to track site locations and the parts manufactured at each facility, as well as monitor any disruptive events that may occur there. This system is called Elementum, and it has proven so successful that it has been spun off into its own company.\r\n\r\nFlex has integrated Elementum supply chain management applications into Flex Pulse, a software-based mobile collaboration tool that provides unprecedented real-time intelligence for managing global supply chains.\r\n\r\nAt Flex Pulse Center, in its Bay Area offices in the heart of Silicon Valley, Flex can track and trace any shipment of potential issue on its supply chain. The Elementum data is visualized by an enormous touchscreen, arching across the front of hot desks for its team. This presents a constant stream of information to be analysed, dissected and converted into decisive actions.\r\n\r\nWith its low lighting and rotating globes, the room achieves a rare feat: it makes supply chain management look cool. But the chic new system has yielded some real success stories for the team.\r\n\r\nIn August 2015, the Chinese port city of Tianjin was rocked by a series of explosions at the container storage station. The total death count was 173 and over 797 injuries. The resulting confusion further disrupted business operations. Information around the event was scarce and unreliable. The Chinese government even censored &ldquo;Tianjin&rdquo; and &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; from the internet behind the Great Firewall Of China.\r\n\r\nThe alert flagged a problem to Flex 30 minutes before the news hit the mainstream media. Flex&rsquo;s travel management company was alerted, who identified a number of company employees were in the area. These were quickly contacted and transported from the affected zone, before the roads to the city were closed by the authorities for 24 hours.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\nAfter the staff were secured, reviews of the supplier facilities were made. Indeed, such was Flex&rsquo;s level of access, they often knew more about the disruption than the supplier.\r\n\r\nFlex created a &lsquo;situation room&rsquo; in Chennei, India. This co-ordinated the impact assessment efforts and allowed the team to analyse the full extent of the disruptions and engage in a detailed analysis of affected part-numbers at a line-item level. Fortunately, the production impact was negligible and operations resumed with little material impact. &ldquo;$15 million was stake&rdquo; said Fic thanks to Flex&rsquo;s new systems, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t lose a dollar&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nIn another more recent example, Flex&rsquo;s supply chain was also exposed to the during the Kumamoto earthquake in Japan on April 2016. In this instance, over $40 million was at risk. Given the critical vulnerability, the company&rsquo;s VP of Commodity Management flew out  to ensure supply. Again, given the flow of Elementum data, Flex enjoyed a greater degree of knowledge that the suppliers. The speed of the response and the access to key decision makers afforded by a senior representative ensured that no significant costs or delays were suffered.\r\n\r\nThe tool also allows for improving internal communication, with chat room communications established around each risk event. Any interested parties can join, demonstrating supply chain managers&rsquo; solid handling of a potentially damaging situation to the entire company. Even C-level officers have followed these updates, showing the value of a supply chain function that is often dismissed as &lsquo;back office&rsquo;.\r\n\r\nNot so in Flex. Their new tool has place supply managers into real value centre of the organisation. Perhaps such tools will bring greater price and availability security to the entire global supply chain.</p>","description":"Quietly, and in an effort to gain supply chain transparency, Flex has built a system to help spot risks, track orders and generally bring an unprecedented level of information about its supply chain operations.

Most of the time, we’ll never know the causes of surprise cost increase that can come from a supply shortages in a component good, or an industrial strike at a supplier’s plant.</p>\n<p>Quietly, and in an effort to gain supply chain transparency, Flex (which rebranded, changing its name from “Flextronics” last year) has built a system to help spot risks, track orders and generally bring an unprecedented level of information about its supply chain operations. The Silicon Valley-based technology and manufacturer has built a new technology platform to pierce deep into its supply chain.</p>\n<p>To the uninitiated, this sounds unexceptional, even expected. However, the dirty secret with much of corporate America is that it struggles with technology. It even struggles with knowing who its suppliers are.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>It’s not unusual for companies to have over 10,000 suppliers and each of these, replete with multiple orders and goods in transit, is virtually impossible to track. Most companies don’t even try. Consequently, we see many disruption and sustainability scandals hit the press, with the affected organisation just as surprised by the supply chain revelations as the press.</p>\n<p>This is also a problem from a knowledge perspective. Most supply chain managers lack the accurate <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/risk/\" target=\"_self\">risk</a> information to inform their decision making. They are also ill-equipped with tracking tools.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Firms are often reluctant to make the investment into risk analysis and mitigation tools because of the cost. Senior management are reluctant to part with millions when they cannot quantify a clear business case. How do you count the benefits of a risk avoided?</p>\n<p>As a result, some companies are paralysed by lack of credible numbers.</p>","<p>In more than 30 countries and over 100 facilities around the world, Flex takes a creative view of risk. The flip side of risk is opportunity. A dynamic, uncertain situation breeds opportunities to move faster than competitors.</p>\n<p>“Risk factors have tangible results that we definitely report to our board,” says Marcin Fic,  Vice President, Supply Chain Solutions. “But some factors are intangible. Speed, for example, is a critical factor here and it’s something that our executives want. Velocity of the supply chain fuels our efficiency, improves our competitiveness and that of our customers, and helps deliver superior numbers..”</p>\n<p>To achieve greater velocity within its supply chain, Flex has developed its own sophisticated system of data collection and aggregation to provide more visibility into its supplier operations. This data allows a company to track site locations and the parts manufactured at each facility, as well as monitor any disruptive events that may occur there. This system is called Elementum, and it has proven so successful that it has been spun off into its own company.</p>\n<p>Flex has integrated Elementum supply chain management applications into Flex Pulse, a software-based mobile collaboration tool that provides unprecedented real-time intelligence for managing global supply chains.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>At Flex Pulse Center, in its Bay Area offices in the heart of Silicon Valley, Flex can track and trace any shipment of potential issue on its supply chain. The Elementum data is visualized by an enormous touchscreen, arching across the front of hot desks for its team. This presents a constant stream of information to be analysed, dissected and converted into decisive actions.</p>\n<p>With its low lighting and rotating globes, the room achieves a rare feat: it makes supply chain management look cool. But the chic new system has yielded some real success stories for the team.</p>\n<p>In August 2015, the Chinese port city of Tianjin was rocked by a series of explosions at the container storage station. The total death count was 173 and over 797 injuries. The resulting confusion further disrupted business operations. Information around the event was scarce and unreliable. The Chinese government even censored “Tianjin” and “explosion” from the internet behind the Great Firewall Of China.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>The alert flagged a problem to Flex 30 minutes before the news hit the mainstream media. Flex’s travel management company was alerted, who identified a number of company employees were in the area. These were quickly contacted and transported from the affected zone, before the roads to the city were closed by the authorities for 24 hours.</p>","<p>After the staff were secured, reviews of the supplier facilities were made. Indeed, such was Flex’s level of access, they often knew more about the disruption than the supplier.</p>\n<p>Flex created a ‘situation room’ in Chennei, India. This co-ordinated the impact assessment efforts and allowed the team to analyse the full extent of the disruptions and engage in a detailed analysis of affected part-numbers at a line-item level. Fortunately, the production impact was negligible and operations resumed with little material impact. “$15 million was stake” said Fic thanks to Flex’s new systems, “we didn’t lose a dollar”.</p>\n<p>In another more recent example, Flex’s supply chain was also exposed to the during the Kumamoto earthquake in Japan on April 2016. In this instance, over $40 million was at risk. Given the critical vulnerability, the company’s VP of Commodity Management flew out  to ensure supply. Again, given the flow of Elementum data, Flex enjoyed a greater degree of knowledge that the suppliers. The speed of the response and the access to key decision makers afforded by a senior representative ensured that no significant costs or delays were suffered.</p>\n<p>The tool also allows for improving internal communication, with chat room communications established around each risk event. Any interested parties can join, demonstrating supply chain managers’ solid handling of a potentially damaging situation to the entire company. Even C-level officers have followed these updates, showing the value of a supply chain function that is often dismissed as ‘back office’.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Not so in Flex. Their new tool has place supply managers into real value centre of the organisation. Perhaps such tools will bring greater price and availability security to the entire global supply chain.</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"doNotPaginate":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business","displayName":"Business"},{"id":"channel_1section_111","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Logistics & Transportation","url":"/logistics-transportation","displayName":"Logistics & Transportation"},{"id":"channel_3","channelName":"Tech","url":"/technology","displayName":"Tech"},{"id":"channel_3section_104","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Data Driven","url":"/data-driven","displayName":"Data Driven"},{"id":"channel_3section_149","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Transformational Tech","url":"/transformational-tech","displayName":"Transformational Tech"},{"id":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership","displayName":"Leadership"},{"id":"channel_6section_116","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Risk","url":"/risk","displayName":"Risk"}],"pTagCount":20,"editorsPick":false,"numberOfImages":1,"brandVoiceTitle":"Flex Takes A Silicon Valley Approach To Reducing Supply Chain Risk","allIndividualAuthors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1868233","name":"Jonathan Webb","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/10/Jonathan-Webb_avatar_1444408010-40x40.png"},{"size":62,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/10/Jonathan-Webb_avatar_1444408010-62x62.png"},{"size":136,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/10/Jonathan-Webb_avatar_1444408010-136x136.png"},{"size":400,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/10/Jonathan-Webb_avatar_1444408010.PNG"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jwebb/","primaryChannel":{"id":"channel_1","channelId":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business","shortName":"Business","displayName":"Business"},"type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/jwebb/","twitterName":"j_p_webb","authorType":"individual","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jonathan-webb/17/b77/350","email":"j.webb@procurementleaders.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about the supply chain and corruption.","webSite":"http://www.procurementleaders.com/","timestamp":1464793832740,"description":"I am a researcher into supply chain management and corporate procurement.
